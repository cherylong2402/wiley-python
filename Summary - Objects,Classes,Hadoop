CLASS
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members

class definitions begin with a class keyword.

eg
class MyNewClass:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    pass

OBJECT
An Object is an instance of a Class.
You can have many classes to create many different instances(objects), but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.

All the instances(objects) share the attributes and the behavior of the class. 
But the values of those attributes are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances(objects).


An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.
